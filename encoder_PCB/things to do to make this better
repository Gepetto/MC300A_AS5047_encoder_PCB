1-Make the 5V and the 3V3 tracks wider
2-put two vertical connectors instead of 1
3- signal holes gotta be 1mm, and add two more signal holes that are smaller 0.3mm and another connector of two signals connected to the two holes
4-condensators gotta be closer to their assigned pins, even in the pcb layout
5-name the pins in each connector in those made for testing/measurements
6-make a filled zone, for the 3V3 volts to make it easier to connect
7-at the end, add a bunch of Viases to connect the GND between all the filled zones
8-ask if one of the connectors is always on the other side of not
9-the amass is now in the middle, that's it
